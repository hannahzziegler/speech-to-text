# speech-to-text



Here are my expansive thoughts. 

I transcribed a video of Pines discussing the university's current rankings on U.S. News, etc. Whisper did an excellent job overall and completed this task just as efficiently as Otter could. The only flaw in the transcription generated was in generating this text: "Number 1 School for LGBTQ Plus Students." If we were publishing this somewhere, we'd want to defer to "No. 1 school for LGBTQ+ students." Both the capitalization and way this was transcribed make perfect sense in the context of the video. I'm not sure how Whisper would translate special characters such as "+" or "%".

Overall, I'm very impressed. I think the UI for this tool is not the most user-friendly compared to the ease of copy and pasting something from Otter. But I feel comfortable saying that Whisper can be just as accurate as Otter and could help avoid issues finding timestamps for something, as it displays those much more prominently than Otter's strategy of "big block of text --> timestamp displayed every 2ish minutes"
